# 👋 Hi, I'm Gonzalo — HermesIA

Since I was 6 years old, when *Cosmos* by Carl Sagan fell into my hands, I knew my love for science would be unconditional.  
That passion led me to find my natural place in the universe: **Artificial Intelligence**.

Here, I found a space where my curiosity can explore and create without limits.  
Like Sagan, I dream of bringing science closer to people. In my case, through AI.
